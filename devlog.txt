For the initial project for DFPI
https://github.com/Motifff/-Co-evolution_Lab

I have done two MAJOR contributions

1.  Binding stone rigid bodies to the skeletal system 
    and orienting skeletal animation to 2D space in Unity
2.  Use the tutorial to create a sea of particles 
    and the degree of skeletal motion bound to 
    the amplitude of the waves.
